This repo contains some boilerplate Typescript React code and a custom HTTP request function.

You will need Node 18 or later and [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) installed.

You should be able to run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to get the app running locally.

During the technical interview we'll ask you to fetch some data from a publicly documented REST API
and display it on screen. Youâ€™ll need to use a different REST endpoint than we have in the code already.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
